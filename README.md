# Why?
This is perfect for university. Dirty libraries for my dirty projects.

# How to use
It follows (I think) the typical API for any database. You should know what's going on by reading the header.

# How about 'x' feature?
Nope. Nothing planned now or ever. Feel free to fork and do whatever you want.

# "I found an error"
Yeah, well. I guess there are tons of them in this, but unless it's something very critical, there's nothing to be done (at least in this repo).
